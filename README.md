# Hierarchichal-Finite-State-Machine

State machines are really useful when it comes to handling multiple actions at the same time such as walking, standing and jumping states. This code was executed while being a part of huge project similar to mortal kombat which works based on Hierarchical finite state machine.

When a state machine has only two states and two types of state transitions, it is usually simple to work with. Because this project requires a variety of states (e.g., standing, jumping, walking in each of the states the behavior is different. Each state has multiple actions which needs to be performed when a button is pressed. Hence, Hierarchical state machine is used to handle multiple states.
